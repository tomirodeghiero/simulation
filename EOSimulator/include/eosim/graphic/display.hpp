 * <p>This class brings a graphical environment to the programmer so he can develop a 2D graphical simulation. To use it
 * an instance of Display must be created as a Model's attribute. Only one instance of Display can be created per run. The
 * window created will be opened while the instance persists.</p> 
 * <p>To synchronize the display with the simulation Display::advance is implemented. We have to invoke this operation every
 * time the simulation advance the time, which is the responsibility of RefreshGraphic Event.</p>
 * <p>During the run many objects and messages should appear in order to see how the simulation is running, for that there
 * are Sprite y TextSprite (for graphics and text). These elements are linked to a display (in the constructor), and  they
 * will appear in the display until there are no references to them, excepting those from the display.</p>

		*
		* <code class="fragment">my_sprite.setMoves(move(2,4,6));</code>

		*
		* <code class="fragment">my_sprite.setMoves(move(2,4,6).move(0,0,8));</code>
		*
		* here the Sprite will go first to (2,4) then to (0,0) in 14 time units (6 to (2,4) then to 8 to (0,0)).
		* <p>Once those waypoints have been assigned, Display::advance moves sprites and textSprites for their assigned 
		* waypoints continously, until there are no more moves assigned. A new invocation of this operation will remove old
		* waypoints and the movement will start from the object actual position.</p>
