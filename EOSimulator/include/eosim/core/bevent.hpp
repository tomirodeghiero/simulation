 *  \version 1.0.1
 *  \date    2005
 *  \brief  B Events
 
 * <p>This is the parent class of all B events. A BEvent (bounded event) is an relevant point of time which is
 * going to occur at a certain time to a certain group of entities.</p>
 * <p>BEvent is an abstract class which represents a bounded event that is relevant to a system. BEvents are 
 * stateless objects; they must not have any attribute that change over a simulation. They are just treated as a 
 * sample of code which is executed by the entities. Remember that BEvents are Model’s attributes.</p>
 * <p>Like in Model, to create a subclass of BEvent you must implement three methods:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>a constructor,</li>
 *		<li>a destructor,</li>
 *		<li>and BEvent::eventRoutine.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>Every BEvent has a name and belongs to a Model. BEvent::name is very important because it is the key used by
 * Model to schedule an entity. Besides, BEvents have the attribute BEvent::owner to have access to its model.
 * These parameters appear in BEvent constructor and it must be called at the constructor of any subclass. It
 * could be a good idea to keep all names in a separate header file in order to make fewer mistakes scheduling
 * entities. <b>BEvents have to be registered using Model::registerBEvent,</b> otherwise when scheduling an entity
 * to a certain BEvent, it won't be found an error will be raised.</p>
 * <p>BEvent::eventRoutine is the main operation of this class. It defines every action taken in that particular
 * point in time. BEvents acts over one specific entity and may change the state of the model. If one event 
 * creates or deletes an Entity, see the rules decripted in the documentation of that class.</p>
