 *  \date    2005
 *  \brief  Entity
 
 * <p>This is the parent class of all entities. Entity is a class that represents objects or components of the
 * system whose activities are modeled. EOSimulator provides a primitive entity which has both a BEvent and a time
 * stamp that indicates the entity’s last bounded event, the clock. If your model needs a more specific entity, 
 * just implement a new subclass.</p>
 * <p>There’s a particular issue when it comes to entities: <b>All entities of a system must be created 
 * dynamically, even global or permanent entities. And only temporary entities must be deleted when they
 * leave the system.</b></p>
 * <p>That's because of the way that EOSimulator containers are implemented. Entity containers
 * have pointers to its elements, in order to avoid copies. When their destructor is called, it destroys every
 * entity stored. When a simulation ends, every entity is scheduled or waiting in a queue, so they are in an
 * EOSimulator’s container. Entity containers have pointers to its elements, in order to avoid copies. When their
 * destructor is called, it destroys every entity stored. This policy is imposed by EOSimulator
 * but it must be controlled by the user (see Collections).</p>
