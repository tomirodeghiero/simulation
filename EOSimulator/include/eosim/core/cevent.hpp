 *  \date    2005
 *  \brief  C Events
 
 * <p>This is the parent class of all C events. A CEvent (conditional event) only occur when the model meets
 * certain conditions (resources availability, queue positions, etc).</p>
 * <p>CEvent is an abstract class which represents a conditional event that is relevant to a system. CEvents are
 * stateless objects and Model’s attributes as well as BEvent.</p>
 * <p>To create a subclass of CEvent you must implement three methods:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>a constructor,</li>
 *		<li>a destructor,</li>
 *		<li>and CEvent::eventRoutine.</li>
 * </ul>
 * CEvents are very much like BEvents, the only difference is that BEvents occur at a certain time to a certain
 * group of entities. But, CEvents occur when its model meets certain conditions such as resources availability.
 * That’s why BEvent::eventRoutine is applied to an entity and CEvent::eventRoutine is applied to its model. 
 * <b>CEvents have to be registered using Model::registerCEvent;</b> an unregistered CEvent will not have any 
 * effect in its model, but it won't rise an error (simply it won't be executed).</p>
 * <p>All CEvents belong to a Model, they have the attribute CEvent::owner to have access to its model. This 
 * parameter appear in CEvent constructor and it must be called at the constructor of any subclass.</p>
 * <p>CEvent::eventRoutine defines every action taken in this particular point in time. CEvents acts over many
 * unspecific entities, and may change the state of the model. If one event creates or deletes an Entity, see
 * the rules decripted in the documentation of that class.</p>
