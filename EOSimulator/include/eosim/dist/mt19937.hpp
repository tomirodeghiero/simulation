// The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers.  It
// was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
// The period, 2^19937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions,
// are far greater.  The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and
// division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.  For more information
// see the inventors' web page at http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html

// Change log:
//
// v0.1 - First release on 15 May 2000
//      - Based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus
//      - Translated from C to C++
//      - Made completely ANSI compliant
//      - Designed convenient interface for initialization, seeding, and
//        obtaining numbers in default or user-defined ranges
//      - Added automatic seeding from /dev/urandom or time() and clock()
//      - Provided functions for saving and loading generator state
//
// v0.2 - Fixed bug which reloaded generator one step too late
//
// v0.3 - Switched to clearer, faster reload() code from Matthew Bellew
//
// v0.4 - Removed trailing newline in saved generator format to be consistent
//        with output format of built-in types
//
// v0.5 - Improved portability by replacing static const int's with enum's and
//        clarifying return values in seed(); suggested by Eric Heimburg
//      - Removed MAXINT constant; use 0xffffffffUL instead
//
// v0.6 - Eliminated seed overflow when uint32 is larger than 32 bits
//      - Changed integer [0,n] generator to give better uniformity
//
// v0.7 - Fixed operator precedence ambiguity in reload()
//      - Added access for real numbers in (0,1) and (0,n)
//
// v0.8 - Included time.h header to properly support timet and clockt
//
// v1.0 - Revised seeding to match 26 Jan 2002 update of Nishimura and Matsumoto
//      - Allowed for seeding with arrays of any length
//      - Added access for real numbers in [0,1) with 53-bit resolution
//      - Added access for real numbers from normal (Gaussian) distributions
//      - Increased overall speed by optimizing twist()
//      - Doubled speed of integer [0,n] generation
//      - Fixed out-of-range number generation on 64-bit machines
//      - Improved portability by substituting literal constants for long enum's
//      - Changed license from GNU LGPL to BSD
