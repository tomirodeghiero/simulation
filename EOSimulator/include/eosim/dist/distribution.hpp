 *  \brief  Distribution abstract class
 
 * <p>Pseudo-random number generators and distribution play a critical roll in computer simulations. Good
 * generators ensure randomness between runs. So every simulation library must provide these facilities. 
 * EoSimulator implements some of the most common distributions and provides one generator, but its design allows
 * more than one generator.</p>
 * <p>EoSimulator has no fixed number of streams. When a distribution is created, a new generator of user defined
 * type is assigned to it. The generator’s type is defined by a GenType label (GenType is declared together with
 * the NumberGenerator interface). The generator is a Distribution’s private attribute. For example:
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <code class="fragment">
 * NegExpDist my_dist(MT19937, lambda); <code class="comment">// this is a Negative Exponencial Distribution with rate lambda, created using the generator Mt19937</code><br>
 * </code>
 * <br>
 * <br></p>
 * <p>To get a sampled value from a distribution, invoke the operation Distribution::sample on any Distribution’s
 * subclass:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>LogNormalDist: LogNormal Distribution,</li>
 *		<li>NegexpDist: Negative Exponencia Distribution,</li>
 *		<li>NormalDist: Normal Distribution,</li>
 *		<li>PoissonDist: Poisson Distribution,</li>
 *		<li>UniformDist: Uniform Distribution,</li>
 *		<li>or any other user subclass.</li>
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>You can also change the generator’s seed with the operation Distribution::setSeed. EoSimulator doesn’t support
 * antithetic streams, but it can be easily implemented.</p>
