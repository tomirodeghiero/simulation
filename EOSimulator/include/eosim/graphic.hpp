 * \defgroup graphic_group Graphic Simulations

 * <p>Graphical Simulations are very usefull for validation, it gives a view of the system which is difficult to obtain using
 * only the data collecte during several simulations. EOSimulator (since version 1.1.1) support 2D iconic animation of
 * simulation, based on <b><a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost C++ Libraries</a>, <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/index.php">
 * SDL</a>, <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/"> SDL_image</a>, <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">
 * Antigrain Geometry</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a></b>. This part of the library was mainly developed as part of a Degree Thesis of Sebasti&aacute;n
 * Alaggia, Bruno Mart&iacute;nez and Fernando Pardo.</p>
 * <p>For developing graphical simulations, EOSimulator provides three clases and a CEvent:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>eosim::graphic::Display: This class defines the environment to develop a graphical simulation: a window, a
			container of the objects that will be drawn and moved during the simulation. You can put a background image in
			the window to create a "more realistic" simulation</li>
 *		<li>eosim::graphic::Sprite: A sprite is an object that could be drawn and move in the window. Sprites are drawn by
			assigning them an image file.</li>
 *		<li>eosim::graphic::TextSprite: Is the same concept that display, but with written text.</li>
 *		<li>eosim::graphic::RefreshGraphic: This is a CEvent which will synchronize the display with the calendar. This
 *			CEvent must be the last one registered in a graphical model.</li>
 * </ul>
