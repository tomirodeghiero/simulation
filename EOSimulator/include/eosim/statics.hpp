/**
 * \defgroup statics_group Data Collectors
 * <br>

 * <p>Another important part of simulation software is output data collectors. They are used to collect data 
 * from simulation’s output parameters. Later, these data are analyzed statistically. The data collectors
 * provided by EOSimulator are histograms.</p> 
 * <p><b>Histograms store bidimentional data (x,y) in tables ordered uniquely by x, and are accumulated in the y.</b>
 * For example if (x1, y1) and (x1, y2) are logged (using the corresponding log operation) in the histogram, the
 * stored value is (x1, y1 + y2). This data collector also calculates the mean value and the standard deviation of
 * the collected data.</p>
 * <p>There are three kinds of histograms in EOSimulator, all of them subclases of eosim::statics::Histogram which
 * defines the behavior of every histogram in EOSimulator:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>eosim::statics::Observation: This histogram store observations; the number of times that the value x has
 * been measured in a variable,</li>
 *		<li>eosim::statics::TimeSeries: This histogram records the evolution of a variable over time; a serie of values
 * over time,</li>
 *		<li>eosim::statics::TimeWeighted; This histogram records the how much time has a variable sustained a given 
 * value.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>Besides of store data, histograms can be displayed in diferent formats:
 * <ul>
 *		<li>table: a table of values separeted by tabs using eosim::statics::Histogram::table;</li>
 *		<li>graphical: an horizontal asterix-bar graph with the values eosim::statics::Histogram::print.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both formats could be written in the standard output or in a file.</p>
